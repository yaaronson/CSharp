Hey, I Know that this is a very competitive position and that I am not applying from an Ivy league university + I am not even sure if this application will reach a human or just be tossed by some AI recruiting manager bot, but in the case that it does I just want to say that aside for my coding skills I bring many other good things to the table, such as leadership and excellent communication skills, which I'm not just saying to sound impressive, I do a lot of freelance work on the side and I develop websites/apps and a lot of times I will take on projects and then hire a team of developers/graphic designers/ media buyers etc.. and manage all of them while being a full time student. Additionally, I have a passion for ecommerce and have been developing brands for many years with successful exits, but one of the main things I have learnt from that is how to leverage Social Media Ads (Meta/TikTok/Snapchat) to fuel my brands and take them to the next levels, I can go on and on about this but  I do not want to make this
